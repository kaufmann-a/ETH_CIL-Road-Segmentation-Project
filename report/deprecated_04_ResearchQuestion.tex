\section{Research Question (opt)}

Research question idea: How much does model archidecture contribute to the model score compared to the influence of preprocessing, postprocessing and hyperparametertuning.\\ \\




The taskdescription mentions that we should formulate our research question based on two baseline models e.g. those from the exercise session.\\\\
Baselines Exercise session:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic Regression
    \item Simple 3-Layer \acrshort{cnn}
    \item \acrshort{unet}\\\\
\end{itemize}

Proposal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \acrshort{unet}
    \item \acrshort{gcdcnn}
    \item \textcolor{green}{TODO: Maybe use ResUnet as baseline}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{TODOs}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have to define two baselines to which we compare our results
    \item We have to describe the baselines, and state the results 
    \item We have to formulate a research question based on the baselines
\end{itemize}
