\section{Summary}

In this project we investigated the contribution of complex model architectures in comparison to other factors and conclude that the exact model architecture plays only a minor role.
Furthermore, we proposed and evaluated two post-processing techniques, which improved our Kaggle public score only slightly, but enhanced the visual quality of the predictions significantly.

%In this project we have investigated the contribution of complex model architectures in comparison to other factors and concluded that the exact model architecture plays only a minor role even when  fine tuned. Furthermore, we proposed and evaluated several post-processing techniques, which were only partly able to improve our Kaggle Public Score, but some methods enhanced the predictions visually by removing artefacts or by connecting road fragments.
