# CIL Course Project 2021: Road Segmentation

## Abstract

A major part of recent research in the field of semantic image segmentation directs attention to the development of
slight architecture variations of increasing complexity. In this work, we analyze the impact of architecture
modifications of a U-Net, namely the GC-DCNN and other self-developed variations. We find that the exact model
architecture results in solely minor changes in prediction accuracy. Comparing this to other factors in the modeling
pipeline, we conclude that the greatest impact can be reached by using a large and diverse training set. Considering the
minor contribution of model architecture alternations, we propose two post-processing techniques. Albeit not improving
prediction accuracy significantly, these procedures are able to improve some of the predicted roads visually.

## Findings & Results

### Data

The ETH training data comprises only 100 train images and 94 test images. The train image are not only different in
size (400x400 vs. 608x608) from the ETH test data but are also of different quality. Comparing the mean histograms we
find that the test images are missing a lot of color intensity values. These facts increase the complexity of the
problem and make it harder to generalize from the train images to the test images.

</p>

Since we only have 100 training images we increased our training set by:

- creating augmented ETH images. For that we flipped the original image and stored it separately. Further we saved the
  rotated versions (by 90, 180, 270 degrees) of the original and the flipped image. This increases the training set from
  100 images to a total of 800 images. (see [ETH-dataset](./data/training/eth_dataset))
- using additional training data from Google Maps: [GMaps-public](./data/training/gmaps_public)
  , [GMaps-custom](./data/training/gmaps_custom)

### Models

We employed two models the [U-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) and
the [GC-DCNN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025520304862). To evaluate the influence of the
architecture we additionally adapt both models to improve the predictive results. In the following we refer to the
**U-Net plus** as the U-Net where we increased the pool kernel size from 2 to 4 resulting in a slight improvement.
The **GC-DCNN plus** refers to a deeper version of the original GC-DCNN and can be viewed as a novel combination of the
GC-DCNN with the modules [Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915v2) (used as a bridge
replacing the Pyramid Pooling Module) and the [attention gate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03999v3) (used in the upwards
branch).

## Postprocessing

TODO: short description + image (same as in report)

### Results

- the largest factor was contributed by using more data
- the model architecture as well as the postprocessing played an important but in comparison a minor factor

## Project Code Structure

Below we give a short non-exhaustive overview of the different folders and files together with their usage.

```
+-- cil-road-segmentation
   +-- data                      [contains the training data]
   +-- ...
   +-- road_segmentation_main
       +-- configurations        [folder that contains the training parameters in form of *.jsonc files]
       +-- source                [contains the main code to train and run the models]
       +-- train.py              [script to run a training]
       +-- inference.py          [script to predict on the test data]
       +-- ensemble.py           [script that creats out of mutliple preditions an ensemble prediction by averaging]
       +-- ...
```

Our code is build such that it allows to

1. reproduce runs
2. compare runs
3. keep results of finished runs

We use configuration files to simplify not only to run different models with different configurations but also to
reproduce past runs. Configuration files can be found in the
folder `cil-road-segmentation/road_segmentation_main/configurations`. They allow to change the dataset, data
augmentations, model, model parameters, optimizer, learning rate scheduler, and so on. Moreover, logging with
`tensorboard` and `comet` gives us the ability to track and compare results of different runs at ease. For every run a
"run-folder" is created which takes the name `<datetime>-<configfile-name>`. This folder keeps the `stdout` log,
the `tensorboard` log and additionally the model weights-checkpoint. This serves as a back up of executed runs.

## Reproducibility

- python version: 3.8.5
- cuda: 10.1.243
- cudnn: 7.6.4
- gcc 6.3.0
- python library version according to [requirements](./road_segmentation_main/requirements.txt) file

### Setup on leonhard cluster

1. Clone `git clone git@github.com:FrederikeLuebeck/cil-road-segmentation.git`
2. Setup environment
    - Load software modules: `module load gcc/6.3.0 python_gpu/3.8.5 tmux/2.6 eth_proxy`
    - Create virtual env and install packages:
        - `cd ./cil-road-segmentation/`
        - `python -m venv my_venv`
        - `source ./my_venv/bin/activate`
        - `pip install -r ./road_segmentation_main/requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file in the folder `cil-road-segmentation/road_segmentation_main`
    - `cd road_segmentation_main/`
    - `vim .env`
        ```
        DATA_COLLECTION_DIR=../data/training
        OUTPUT_DIR=trainings
        ```
    - On the leonhard cluster it is advisable to use the scratch as output directory, due to space constraints of the
      home directory. For instance use
      `OUTPUT_DIR=/cluster/scratch/<username>/cil_trainings`.

##

### General: loading environment

1. `cd ./cil-road-segmentation/`
2. Load software modules: `module load gcc/6.3.0 python_gpu/3.8.5 tmux/2.6 eth_proxy`
3. Load python env: `source ./my_venv/bin/activate`
4. If you want to work with tmux, start tmux with `tmux` (see tmux guide below)

### Run training

1. Load environment
2. Navigate to the road segmentation folder `cd road_segmentation_main/`
3. Edit the configuration file to your needs
    - `vim ./configurations/default.jsonc`
4. Run job on GPU
    - shorter
      run: `bsub -n 2 -J "training-job" -W 4:00 -R "rusage[mem=10240, ngpus_excl_p=1]" -R "select[gpu_mtotal0>=10240]" 'python train.py --configuration ./configurations/default.jsonc'`
        - change the configuration file name if you use a different one `--configuration ./configurations/default.jsonc`
    - longer run with larger
      dataset: `bsub -n 4 -J "long-run" -W 24:00 -R "rusage[mem=10240, ngpus_excl_p=1]" -R "select[gpu_model0==GeForceRTX2080Ti]" 'python train.py --configuration ./configurations/default.jsonc'`
    - check job status `bbjobs -w`
    - peek stdout log `bpeek` or `bpeek -f` to continuously read the log
5. Find your training results with `ls ./trainings/`

#### Reproducibility

We used following base submission command on the Leonhard cluster which selects enough cpu memory as well as the 2080Ti
GPU.

```
bsub -n 4 -J "description" -W 24:00 -R "rusage[mem=10240, ngpus_excl_p=1]" -R "select[gpu_model0==GeForceRTX2080Ti]" 'python <....>'
```

To get reproducible results we fixed the random seeds of `torch`, `random` and `numpy` at various points in the code.
Additionally, we set `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` as suggested on the official pytroch reproducibility
page: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.0/notes/randomness.html.

The results of the U-Net are 100% reproducible. The GC-DCNN lacks exact reproducibility because the pyramid pooling
module (PPM) uses the pytorch function `F.interpolate`
which is not numerically stable (as in pytroch version 3.8.5). As a result we evaluated how much the validation accuracy
varies, by running 10 runs of the GC-DCNN baseline using the "experiments dataset".

- min validation accuracy: 0.9724 (removed one outlier with validation accuracy of 0.9715)
- max validation accuracy: 0.9732

##### Baselines

For the baselines we use the "experiments dataset" which is a combination of the ETH and the GMaps-public dataset with a
predefined train and validation split. The images of the GMaps-public dataset were center cropped to size 400x400 to
match the ETH dataset image size.
